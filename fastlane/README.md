# Staging build  
ENVFILE=.env.staging fastlane android_debug

# Production internal build
ENVFILE=.env.production fastlane android_internal

Available Lanes

build_release - Build signed release APK (no upload)
Global Lanes

clean - Clean build artifacts
Examples
# Build debug APK for development
ENVFILE=.env.development fastlane android_debug

# Build and upload to Google Play Internal (staging)
ENVFILE=.env.staging fastlane android_internal

# Build release APK for production (no upload)
ENVFILE=.env.production fastlane build_release

# Clean all build artifacts
ENVFILE=.env.development fastlane clean
