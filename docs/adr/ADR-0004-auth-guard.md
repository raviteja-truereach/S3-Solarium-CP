# ADR-0004: Authentication Guard Implementation

**Date:** 2024-01-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Channel Partner App Authentication & Navigation Protection  

## Context

The Solarium Channel Partner mobile application requires robust authentication-based navigation protection to ensure:
- Unauthenticated users can only access login/registration flows
- Authenticated users are automatically routed to main application features  
- Deep links respect authentication state
- Seamless user experience during authentication state changes
- Prevention of navigation loops or inconsistent states

## Decision

We will implement an **AuthGuard component** that provides declarative authentication-based navigation protection throughout the application.

### Architecture Decision

**Component-Based Guard Pattern:**
```typescript
<AuthGuard requiresAuth={boolean}>
  <ProtectedContent />
</AuthGuard>
