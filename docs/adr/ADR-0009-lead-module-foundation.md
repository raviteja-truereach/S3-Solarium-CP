# ADR-0009: Lead Module Foundation Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2024-01-15

## Context

The CPAPP requires a robust, scalable lead management system that can handle offline-first synchronization, data validation, and efficient pagination. The existing lead implementation lacked proper validation, atomic persistence, and pagination support, leading to potential data inconsistencies and poor performance with large datasets.

### Key Requirements

1. **Offline-First Architecture**: Support for local data persistence with eventual consistency
2. **Data Validation**: Runtime validation of API responses and local data integrity
3. **Pagination Support**: Efficient handling of large lead datasets
4. **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing data persistence to prevent partial updates
5. **Performance**: Support for 100+ leads with <200ms insert performance
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with runtime guards

### Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing lead data
- Cannot introduce heavy external dependencies
- Must work offline with SQLite storage
- Performance critical for mobile devices
- Memory constraints on mobile platforms

## Decision

We have decided to implement a comprehensive Lead Module Foundation with the following architectural decisions:

### 1. Runtime Validation Strategy: Custom Type Guards

**Decision**: Implement custom TypeScript type guards instead of using schema validation libraries (Zod, Yup, Joi).

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Custom guards are 3-5x faster than schema libraries
- **Bundle Size**: Avoids 50-100kb of additional dependencies
- **Mobile Optimization**: Minimal memory footprint and CPU usage
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with compile-time checking
- **Flexibility**: Easy to customize for specific API response formats

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: Lightweight, fast, TypeScript-native, no external dependencies
- ❌ **Cons**: More code to maintain, manual validation logic, no built-in transformation

**Implementation**:
```typescript
export function isApiLead(obj: any): obj is ApiLead {
  return obj && 
    typeof obj.leadId === 'string' &&
    typeof obj.customerName === 'string' &&
    // ... other validations
}
