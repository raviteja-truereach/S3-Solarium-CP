# ADR-0001: CI/CD Pipeline Toolchain Selection

## Status

**Accepted** - 2024-01-15

## Context

The Solarium CP App requires a robust CI/CD pipeline to support automated builds, testing, and deployments across Android and iOS platforms. We need to select appropriate tools for:

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Build automation
- Code quality analysis
- Security scanning
- Artifact management

### Requirements

1. **Cross-platform builds**: Android APK and iOS IPA generation
2. **Multi-environment support**: Development, staging, production
3. **Quality gates**: Linting, testing, coverage thresholds
4. **Security scanning**: Secret detection and vulnerability analysis
5. **Scalability**: Support for ~400-600 concurrent users (target scale)
6. **Cost-effectiveness**: Align with project budget constraints
7. **Team familiarity**: Leverage existing knowledge where possible
8. **Integration**: Seamless integration with Azure-based infrastructure

### Constraints

- Project uses GitHub for source control
- Azure infrastructure for backend and services
- React Native 0.71+ framework
- Mobile app distribution via App Store and Google Play
- Team size: Small to medium development team
- Timeline: Immediate implementation required for project bootstrap

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the following toolchain:

### 1. **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD Orchestration

**Why GitHub Actions:**
- Native integration with GitHub repository
- No additional service setup required
- Built-in secret management
- Excellent GitHub ecosystem integration
- Cost-effective for current team size
- Rich marketplace of pre-built actions

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Azure DevOps**: More complex setup, additional licensing costs
- **Jenkins**: Requires infrastructure management, maintenance overhead
- **CircleCI**: Additional service dependency, cost scaling concerns

### 2. **Fastlane** for Build Automation

**Why Fastlane:**
- Industry standard for mobile app automation
- Excellent React Native integration
- Supports both Android and iOS workflows
- Declarative configuration approach
- Strong community support and documentation
- Handles complex signing and deployment scenarios

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Gradle/Xcode direct**: More manual configuration, less abstraction
- **Bitrise**: Additional SaaS dependency, cost concerns
- **Custom scripts**: Higher maintenance burden, less reliability

### 3. **SonarCloud** for Code Quality Analysis

**Why SonarCloud:**
- Free for open source projects
- Excellent GitHub integration
- Comprehensive code quality metrics
- Security vulnerability detection
- Technical debt analysis
- Supports TypeScript/JavaScript analysis

**Alternatives considered:**
- **CodeClimate**: Similar features, additional cost
- **ESLint only**: Limited to linting, no comprehensive analysis
- **SonarQube self-hosted**: Infrastructure management overhead

### 4. **Gitleaks** for Secret Scanning

**Why Gitleaks:**
- Fast and accurate secret detection
- Low resource requirements
- Configurable rules and baselines
- Open source with active development
- Easy CI/CD integration
- No external service dependencies

**Alternatives considered:**
- **TruffleHog**: Similar features, slightly heavier resource usage
- **GitHub Advanced Security**: Not available for current plan
- **Custom regex scanning**: Less reliable, higher maintenance

### 5. **Azure Key Vault** for Secret Management

**Why Azure Key Vault:**
- Native integration with existing Azure infrastructure
- Robust security and compliance features
- Seamless GitHub Actions integration via OIDC
- Cost-effective for current scale
- Centralized secret management
- Audit logging and access controls

**Alternatives considered:**
- **GitHub Secrets only**: Limited secret management capabilities
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Additional infrastructure complexity
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Would require multi-cloud complexity

    Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
GitHub Actions workflow setup
Basic quality gates (ESLint, TypeScript, Jest)
Fastlane configuration for debug builds
Environment-based configuration
Phase 2: Security & Quality (Next)
Gitleaks integration with baseline management
SonarCloud quality gates
Azure Key Vault integration
Enhanced secret management
Phase 3: Production Ready (Future)
Release automation to app stores
Advanced deployment strategies
Performance monitoring integration
Enhanced notification systems
Consequences
Positive
Reduced complexity: Single toolchain with proven integrations
Cost efficiency: Leverages free/low-cost tiers effectively
Scalability: Can grow with team and project needs
Maintainability: Industry-standard tools with good documentation
Security: Comprehensive secret scanning and management
Quality: Automated quality gates prevent regression
Speed: Fast feedback loops for developers
Negative
GitHub dependency: Heavy reliance on GitHub ecosystem
Learning curve: Team needs Fastlane and GitHub Actions expertise
Complexity: Multiple tools require coordination and maintenance
Vendor lock-in: Migration to other platforms would require significant effort
Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | |------|--------|------------| | GitHub service outages | Build pipeline unavailable | Document manual build processes | | Fastlane breaking changes | Build failures | Pin specific versions, test updates | | Azure Key Vault costs | Budget overrun | Monitor usage, implement cost alerts | | Secret scanning false positives | Pipeline failures | Maintain baseline files, regular reviews | | SonarCloud integration issues | Quality gate failures | Fallback to local analysis, service monitoring |
