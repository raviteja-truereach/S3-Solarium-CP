# Manual Test Checklist - Sync System

## Pre-Test Setup
- [ ] Remove all test code from HomeScreen.tsx
- [ ] Ensure app builds successfully: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`
- [ ] Enable logging: `npx react-native log-ios` or `npx react-native log-android`

## Core Functionality Tests

### 1. Basic Sync Operation
- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Sync scheduler starts automatically (check logs)
- [ ] Sync occurs every 3 minutes (180 seconds)
- [ ] Dashboard data updates after sync
- [ ] No memory leaks over extended operation

### 2. App Lifecycle
- [ ] Background app → scheduler pauses (check logs)
- [ ] Foreground app → scheduler resumes (check logs)  
- [ ] Long background (>30s) → immediate sync on foreground
- [ ] App restart → clean startup with no leftover state

### 3. Error Handling
- [ ] Network disconnection → sync fails gracefully
- [ ] API errors → sync continues, dashboard optional
- [ ] Multiple rapid app state changes → no crashes

### 4. Performance
- [ ] No UI lag during sync operations
- [ ] Memory usage stays stable over time
- [ ] Battery usage is reasonable

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Proper error boundaries implemented

### Performance
- [ ] Memory leak detection working
- [ ] Performance monitoring operational
- [ ] Logging configured for production levels

### Security
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] API endpoints properly secured
- [ ] AsyncStorage data encrypted if needed

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] User experience monitoring

## Sign-off
- [ ] Developer verification completed
- [ ] QA testing passed
- [ ] Performance review approved
- [ ] Security review approved
- [ ] Ready for production deployment
